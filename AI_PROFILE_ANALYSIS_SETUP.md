# AI Profile Analysis Setup Guide

## üéØ Overview

The AI Profile Analysis feature uses OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision model to analyze DJ social media profiles and provide personalized, actionable recommendations based on DJ Tour's specific tools and missions.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `dj-tour/` directory:

# OpenAI API Key for AI Profile Analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here

# Supabase Configuration (if not already set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
```

- No images are stored permanently
- API calls are made server-side only
- Environment variables are kept secure

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

- GPT-4o Vision: ~$0.01-0.03 per analysis
- Typical analysis (3 images + global): ~$0.05-0.10
- Cost-effective for the value provided

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to analyze profiles"**
   - Check your OpenAI API key is correct
   - Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account
   - Verify the images are valid (JPG, PNG, WebP)

2. **API Key not found**
   - Make sure `.env.local` is in the correct directory
   - Restart the development server after adding env variables
   - Check the variable name is exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY`

3. **Slow analysis**
   - GPT-4o is fast but complex analyses take 10-30 seconds
   - Multiple images are processed sequentially
   - Network speed affects response time

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
DEBUG_AI_ANALYSIS=true
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Add environment variables to your hosting platform
2. Ensure OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
3. Monitor usage and costs
4. Consider rate limiting for high-traffic scenarios

## üìà Future Enhancements
